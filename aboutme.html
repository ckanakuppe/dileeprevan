        <h1 class="aboutTextHeading"> Welcome to My Photographic art gallery</h1>
        <p class="aboutTextContent">Let me tell you a short story about myself.</p>
        <p class="aboutTextContent">My first camera was a Kodak 35mm point and shoot film camera, which came free with the purchase of a
          refrigerator. After taking couple of pictures, intrigued by the working of this device the ~12 year old me decided to open up to see the images.
          It was only when my father tried to get the film developed, I learnt the blunder I committed. Long story short, the pictures were corrupted and couldn't recover much.
          After such a disastrous kick start, I couldn't give up and still kept clicking random pictures. Then came the digital revolution and I could take pictures with cellphone, point and shoot and see it instantly, this was totally exciting. Like everyone else, I started taking random pictures in my whole teenage years.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutTextContent">
          Then, after my undergrad I came to USA to pursue my Masters at University of Minnesota Twin Cities. Seeing the beautiful architecture, lined up maple trees, green grass, Mississippi river through the campus, my love towards landscape photography started budding.
          Two years later, the obsession towards landscape photography heightened to its peak when I moved to Portland, Oregon.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutTextContent">
          I got myself a DSLR camera, taught myself how to use it and started hiking in various trails near Gorge, Mt hood etc. Having all sorts of landscape settings like Oregon Coast, Evergreen forests, Waterfalls, Rivers, Desert, Cascade mountains so on and so forth
          , this created an endless opportunity for me to explore and capture the Nature's beauty. The Northwest has been feeding my hunger for outdoors, Nature and Landscape photography ever since by creating unlimited opportunities, this was further expanded by all the beautiful National parks in the USA.
          Backpacking into the wilderness, pushing myself out of bed to see the sunrise, waiting patiently for the Sunset or Clouds or Lake to calm down made me realize the true beauty of nature and scale of humanity in front of that.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutTextContent">
          Main purpose of my galleries is the give a sense of emotion to the viewer that I was able to feel at the moment of capture. I try my best to keep the images and editing realistic but nothing can substitute the actual experience of being on the spot and soaking in the experience.
          I am personally grateful to My Family, My current job, Humble people of Oregon and The Nature itself for enabling me to pursue my love towards landscape photography.
